    <h2>Introduction to Photography</h2>
    <p>
        Photography is the <span class="highlight">art and science</span> of capturing light to create images. 
        It has evolved significantly from early film-based cameras to modern digital photography. 
        Today, photography is used in various fields, including <span class="highlight">journalism, art, science, and social media</span>. 
        With advancements in technology, even smartphones now have powerful cameras, allowing anyone to become a photographer. 
        Photography is not just about taking pictures; it is about <span class="highlight">telling stories, preserving memories, and expressing creativity</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Photography</h2>
    <p>
        There are several types of photography, each requiring different skills and equipment. 
        <span class="highlight">Portrait photography</span> focuses on capturing people and emotions, while 
        <span class="highlight">landscape photography</span> showcases nature and scenic beauty. 
        <span class="highlight">Wildlife photography</span> requires patience and skill to capture animals in their natural habitat. 
        <span class="highlight">Macro photography</span> reveals tiny details by capturing close-up shots of small subjects. 
        <span class="highlight">Street photography</span> documents everyday life, and <span class="highlight">fashion photography</span> 
        is widely used in the modeling and advertising industries. Each type requires a different approach, lighting, and composition to create compelling images.
    </p>

    <h2>Essential Photography Techniques</h2>
    <p>
        A good photograph is a combination of various techniques. 
        The <span class="highlight">rule of thirds</span> helps in composing a balanced shot by placing the subject at intersecting points. 
        <span class="highlight">Lighting</span> plays a crucial role in setting the mood and tone of the image. 
        <span class="highlight">Shutter speed</span> controls motion blur, <span class="highlight">aperture</span> adjusts depth of field, 
        and <span class="highlight">ISO</span> determines the image's brightness and noise level. 
        Post-processing tools like <span class="highlight">Adobe Photoshop</span> and <span class="highlight">Lightroom</span> help enhance images. 
        Understanding these techniques allows photographers to create stunning and impactful visuals.
